Writing tests for fheap

This is an implementation of Fibonacci Heaps in Javascript but on nodejs environment.
As suggested I have been able to write unit tests using nodeunit.

####To run this

npm install
nodeunit test

####Start server

node app.js
  This shows sorted random numbers as both text and numbers.(Its just a JSON string for now)
